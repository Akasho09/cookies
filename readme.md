3. Domains - You can also specify what all domains should the cookie be sent from

## CSRF attacks
Cross site request forgery attacks were super common because of cookies and hence the SameSite attribute was introduced


## imps
- import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";
- app.use(cors({
    credentials: true,
    origin: "http://localhost:5173"
}));
- res.cookie("authToken", token);
- const token = req.cookies.authToken;
-       withCredentials: true,
with every request

## if frontend is serving on same endpoint 
then we dont need cors as weel as credintials .
